## ArtaxApiBuilder


Creates a library to consume an API from a Guzzle-like service description.


## Why?

* Underlying HTTP implementation in Curl/PHP streams isn't that great.

* Still a massive code base that doesn't really do that much.

* Untestable / unreplaceable. 




## Danack/Code vs Zend/Code


Please note, the fork Danack/Code is almost exactly the same as Zend/Code, except that it has some bug fixes which will only be released in the next major version of Zend/Code. As this won't happen for the foreseeable future, this library currently uses my fork with the fixes applied. The plan is to go back to the mainstream version of Zend/Code at the next major release..
